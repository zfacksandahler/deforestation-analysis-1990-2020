# Deforestation Analysis 1990-2020

## Objective
Conduct a reproducible analysis of global forest cover change from 1990 to 2020, identifying significant trends and documenting findings using a complete GitHub project workflow.

## Project Structure
This repository follows a structured scientific workflow:

1. **Data Acquisition and Cleaning** (Issue #1)
2. **Exploratory Analysis and Trend Identification** (Issue #2)
3. **Visualization of Key Findings** (Issue #3)
4. **Final Summary Report Creation** (Issue #4)

## Dataset
The analysis uses a simulated dataset `global_forest_cover.csv` representing annual forest cover metrics (area in hectares) for major global regions from 1990 to 2020.

## Scripts
- `clean_data.py`: Data cleaning and preprocessing script
- `analyze_and_plot.py`: Analysis and visualization script

## Results
Key findings and visualizations will be documented in this README and released as GitHub Releases.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies (Python, pandas, matplotlib)
3. Run `clean_data.py` to preprocess data
4. Run `analyze_and_plot.py` to generate analysis and plots
